            <h2>Md Mostafijur Rahman</h2>
            <p>I am a Ph.D. student at the <strong>The University of Texas at Austin</strong> working with <strong>Prof. Radu Marculescu</strong>. I am a member of <strong>System Level Design Group (SLD) @UT Austin</strong>. My research interests are centered around AI in Healthcare, particularly applying Deep Learning to Biomedical Imaging. I have extensive experience in areas like Lightweight/Efficient AI and Generative AI for 2D/3D Image or Video Segmentation, Reconstruction, Denoising, Enhancement, Translation, Synthesis, and Classification. Additionally, I focus on Self-supervised Learning and Multi-modal AI, both of which are crucial in advancing AI-driven healthcare solutions. In the past, I have interned at National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Robert Bosch Research.</p>
            <p>Prior to joining UT Austin, I was a Graduate Student in Software Engineering at University of Dhaka. I was advised by Prof. Mohammad Shoyaib. I have also spent 4 wonderful years as Assitant Professor and Lecturer at Computer Science and Engineering department, University of barishal. I also worked at Advanced Solution Lab, Samsung Research, Bangladesh as a Senior Software Engineer.</p>
